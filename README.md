# Morse to LCD

This is a project I did some years ago about a device capable of showing up characters in a LCD screen from a single button sequence of presses according to Morse Code. It uses an Arduino Nano board. It should cost less than 30 USD.

In Morse Code, a quick button press is represented as a single dot ("路"). And a long press is represented as a dash ("-").

For example, if the user press the button three times quickly (路路路), the character "S" will be printed out. If the user press the button three times, but not that quickly (---), it will print "O".

I think it can be used by patients with neurodegenerive disorders (among other disabilities) to communicate, since it's easy to press a button.
